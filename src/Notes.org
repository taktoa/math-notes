\begin{enumlist}
@ An \textsf{ideal} $I$ of a ring $R$ should be thought of as a particular kind
  of subset of a ring.
@ Specifically, for some ring $(R, +, {}\cdot{})$, a set $I$ is a
  \textsf{two-sided ideal} of $R$ if it satisfies two conditions:
@@ \textbf{Subgroup}: $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
@@ \textbf{Absorption}: For any $r \in R$ and any $i \in I$, $r \cdot i$ and
   $i \cdot r$ are both elements of $I$.
@ We can generalize this to the notion of a \textsf{left ideal} and a
  \textsf{right ideal}. A left ideal only requires $r \cdot i \in I$, while a
  right ideal only requires $i \cdot r \in I$.
@ The canonical example of an ideal is that of the even integers $2\mbb{Z}$,
  which are an ideal in $\mbb{Z}$.
@@ To see why this is, note that addition is closed over $2\mbb{Z}$, and that
   the additive inverse of an even integer is also even. Thus, $(2\mbb{Z}, +)$
   is a subgroup of $(\mbb{Z}, +)$. The other factor is that multiplying any
   number by an even number gives you another even number, so the absorption
   condition is satisfied.
@ More generally, for any integer $n$ in $\mbb{Z}$,
  $n\mbb{Z}$ is an ideal in $\mbb{Z}$.
@ So you could say that ideals generalize the idea of the set of all values
  divisible by a given value.
@ Other examples:
@@ For any ring $R$, $R$ is trivially an ideal of $R$.
   This is called the \textsf{unit ideal} of $R$.
@@ For any ring $R$, $\{0_R\}$ is an ideal of $R$.
   This is called the \textsf{zero ideal} of $R$.
@@ Denote the ring of all univariate polynomials with real coefficients
   by $\mbb{R}[x]$. Then the set of all such polynomials divisible by $x^2 + 1$
   is an ideal in $\mbb{R}[x]$.
@ Some types of ideals:
@@ A \textsf{proper ideal}  is one that is not the unit ideal.
   A \textsf{nonzero ideal} is one that is not the zero ideal.
@@ The \textsf{maximal ideal} of a ring is the largest possible proper ideal
   for that ring.
@@ The \textsf{minimal ideal} of a ring is the smallest possible nonzero ideal
   for that ring.
@@ A \textsf{prime ideal} is an ideal $I$ such that for any $(a, b) \in R^2$,
   $a \cdot b \in I$ implies $a \in I$ or $b \in I$.
@@ A \textsf{radical} or \textsf{semiprime ideal} is an ideal $I$ such that
   for any $a \in R$, $a^n \in I$ implies $a \in I$.
@@ A \textsf{principal ideal} is an ideal with one generator.
@ The \textsf{quotient of a ring $R$ by an ideal $I$} is
  $(R / \{(a, b) \in R^2 \mid (a - b) \in I\}, +, {}\cdot{})$.
@ Products and sums
@@ Any two ideals $I$ and $J$ have a sum, defined as
   $I + J = \{a + b \mid a \in I \land b \in J\}$.
@@ Any two ideals $I$ and $J$ have a product, defined as
   \begin{equation*}
     I \times J = \{\psi(0) + \cdots + \psi(n)
                    \mid   n \in \mbb{N}
                    \rmand \phi \in \mbb{N} \to I \times J
                    \rmand \psi = \pi \comp \phi\}
   \end{equation*}
   where $\pi : R^2 \to R$ is defined as $\pi(a, b) = a \cdot b$
@@ Note that $(I \cup J) \subseteq (I + J)$
   and $(I \times J) \subseteq (I \cap J)$.
@ The set of ideals of a ring $R$ is denoted $\mbb{I}_R$.
@ For convenience, we will define a function
  $\Phi : (A^2 \to A) \times A \to \mbb{P}(A) \to A$ by:
  \begin{equation*}
    {\Phi(f, e)(\o) = e}
    ~ ~ \rmand ~ ~
    {\Phi(f, e)(\{x\} \cup X) = f(x, \Phi(f, e)(X))}
  \end{equation*}
  where $x \in A$ and $X \subseteq \mbb{P}(A)$.
  This is known as the \textsf{fold} of a binary operator $f$ with a unit $e$.
@ $(\mbb{I}_R, \subseteq, \Phi(+, \{0_R\}), \Phi(\cap, R), \{0_R\}, R)$
  is a complete modular lattice.

@ A \textsf{preorder} is a set $P$ equipped with a relation $(\poset)$ that is
  both reflexive and transitive.
@@ Alternatively, a preorder can be thought of as a category in which for any
   pair of objects $(X, Y)$, we have $\abs{X \to Y} \le 1$.
@@ The \textsf{opposite preorder} for a preorder $P = (X, \poset)$ is defined as
   $\opcat{P} = (X, \tesop)$.
@@ A function $f : (P, \poset_P) \to (Q, \poset_Q)$ is \textsf{monotone} iff

@ A \textsf{poset} is a preorder in which $(\poset)$ is anti-symmetric.
@@ Alternatively, a poset can be thought of as a category in which for any pair
   of objects $(X, Y)$, we have $\abs{(X \to Y) \cup (Y \to X)} \le 1$.
@@ Every preorder $P$ gives rise to a poset $P / (\equiv)$, where
   $a \equiv b \iff (a \poset b) \land (b \poset a)$.
@@ In a given poset $P$, with $X \subseteq P$ and $a \in P$, $a$ is a

@@ A lower bound $a$ of $X$ is a \textsf{meet} if it is greater than or equal to
   any other lower bound.
@@ A \textsf{join} is dual to a meet; if $a$ is a join for $X$ in $P$, then
   $a$ is a meet for $X$ in $\opcat{P}$.
@ A \textsf{pseudolattice} is a poset in which every nonempty finite subset has
  a meet and a join.
@ A \textsf{meet-semilattice} (resp. \textsf{join-semilattice}) is a poset in
  which every finite subset has a meet (resp. join).
@ A \textsf{lattice} is a poset that is both a meet-semilattice and a
  join-semilattice. Alternatively, a lattice is a pseudolattice with empty meets
  and joins (which correspond to unique maximal and minimal elements).
@ \textbf{Theorem}:
  A poset $P$ is a pseudolattice if it has binary meets and joins.
@ \textbf{Corollary}:
  If $P$ also has empty meets and joins, it is a lattice.
@ As a result, we will heretofore denote all finite meets and joins by infix
  binary operators $(\meet)$ and $(\join)$.
@ Infinite meets and joins will look like, e.g.: $\bigmeet_i(p_i)$ for a sequence
  $p : \mbb{N} \to P$ or $\bigmeet(X)$ for some $X \subseteq P$.
@ For lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$, a function $f : L_1 \to L_2$ is a
  \textsf{lattice homomorphism} iff $f(a \meet_1 b) = f(a) \meet_2 f(b)$
  and $f(a \join_1 b) = f(a) \join_2 f(b)$ for all $(a, b) \in L_1^2$.
@ Note that the set of all pseudolattices is closed under $(\opcat{-})$.
@ A poset $P$ is a \textsf{frame} iff every subset has join, every finite subset
  has a meet, and binary meets distribute over joins.
@@ In general, if $F$ is a frame, $\opcat{F}$ is not a frame.
@@ One notable exception is the \textsf{powerset frame} on a set $X$, $\mbb{P}(X)$.
@@ $\mbf{1} = (\{\star\}, \o)$, the \textsf{inconsistent frame}, so named
   because it has $\bot = \top$.
@@ $\mbf{2} = (\{\bot,\top\}, \{(\bot, \top)\})$, the \textsf{Sierpinski frame}.
@ A \textsf{topology} $\Omega$ on a set $X$ is a frame such that $\Omega$ is a
  subframe of $\mbb{P}(X)$.
@ A \textsf{topological space} is a set $X$ equipped with a topology $\Omega$.
@ The elements of $\Omega$ are known as the \textsf{open subsets} of $X$.
@ For a poset $P$ where $x \in P$ and $S \subseteq P$:
@@ ${\uparrow}(x) = \{y \in P \mid x \poset y\}$
   is the \textsf{upper closure} of $x$.
@@ ${\uparrow}(S) = \{y \in P \mid (\exists x \in S ~ . ~ x \poset y)\}$
   is the \textsf{upper closure} of $S$.
@@ The \textsf{lower closure} of $x$ and $S$, denoted by ${\downarrow}(-)$,
   is just the upper closure in $\opcat{P}$.
@ Examples of topologies:
@@ The \textsf{discrete topology} is $\Omega = \mbb{P}(X)$.
@@ The \textsf{indiscrete topology} is $\Omega = \o$.
@@ The \textsf{Alexandrov topology} on a poset $P$ is defined as
   $\Omega = \{{\uparrow}(x) \mid x \in P\}$.
@ We will heretofore denote the topology associated with any given topological
  space $X$ by $\Omega_X$.
@ The \textsf{interior} of a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is
  $\interior(S) = \cup \{A \in \Omega_X \mid A \subseteq S\}$
@@ Note that $\interior(S)$ is always the largest open set contained in $S$.
@ A subset $F \subseteq X$ is \textsf{closed} iff its complement is open.
@ A subset is \textsf{clopen} iff it is both open and closed.
@ The \textsf{topological closure} of a subset $S \subseteq X$ is
